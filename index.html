        <p>
          Located in the heart of Black Creek, our small family farm is growing
          great things for our local community.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will find the freshest produce, berries and non-gmo eggs from our
          pasture in our farmstand seasonally each year.
        </p>
        <p>
          The farmstand runs on the honour system and is stocked up daily right
          at the farm gate!

        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <!--paragraph written by ChatGPT-->
        <p>
          A farm owner is an individual who manages and oversees the operations
          of a farm, typically taking on responsibilities such as planting,
          cultivating, and harvesting crops, maintaining equipment, and managing
          finances. They are often deeply connected to the land and the rhythms
          of nature, with a strong sense of stewardship and a commitment to
          sustainability.
