      <p>
        Kehler Vegetable Company is a small mixed market farm of vegetables,
        berries and eggs from our pasture located on a 20 acre farm in the Comox
        Valley. We are committed to providing the most nutritous, locally grown
        and sustainable produce.
      </p>
      <h3>How We Grow</h3>
      <p>
        Our farm runs on a best practice system, we use a combination of
        management that ensures our produce is the highest quality possible. We
        are not currently certified organic but we do grow all produce and
        vegetables organically. Through the use of mechanical and cultural
        management we keep our farm pests under control. Black plastic mulch,
        flame weeders, roto-tiller and old fashion weeding techniques are used
        to keep encroaching weeds down. Row covers help to keep insect pests out
        of our susceptible crops and a good crop rotation plan ensures that we
        are keeping pests at a minimum from season to season. Fertility is
        managed here by adding well composted cattle manure as well as our own
        manure produced by our laying hen flock. Supplemental organic fertilizer
        is added as needed to our drip irrigation system throughout the season.
      </p>
      <h3>How to Shop with Us</h3>
      <p>
        Our little farmstand is located right at the farm gate, it is run on the
        honour system with a small amount of change available. Hours run
        seasonally Wed-Fri 10-5pm Saturday 9-noon. Our produce is also available
        through wholesale order.
