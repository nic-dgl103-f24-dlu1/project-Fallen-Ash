# Project Part One

## Project Summary

I have chosen to use [Kehler's Vegetable Company Farm
Market](https://www.kehlervegetables.ca/)

- The most important purpose of the site is to advertise the farm and bring customers to their farmstand.

- The target audience would be people who like to buy their produce locally, fresh, non GMO, and organically (though not yet certified organic).

- The overall message would be to make people aware of what the farm grows and where they are able to purchase items. Following the business via instagram and facebook is encouraged to keep up with hours, current stock, and anything in the process of growing.

- We want the audience/customers to look at the site and either visit the location to purchase items, or to contact the business for any questions or wholesale inquiries.

* The current site is not appropriate due to: design(contrast, images not loading, colour scheme), The lighthouse analysis, wave accessbility, and pingdom tests were all very poor results so there is a lot to improve on.
